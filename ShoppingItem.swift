//A ShoppingItem model object with properties for an image, name of the item, and Bool indicating whether the item has been added to the shopping list.

//    On the first launch of the application, use the given shopping item names and images to create instances of the ShoppingItem model, and save them to a file. These shopping items should be persisted between launches of the application. Use UserDefaults to make sure that new shopping items are initialized only once.

//    This snippet has the names of the images in the assets folder. Use it to create the instances of ShoppingList: - let itemNames = ["apple", "grapes", "milk", "muffin", "popcorn", "soda", "strawberries"]

//Upon selecting the custom cell, the item's Bool value should change from true to false or vice-versa.

//A bar button item on the collection view controller that performs a "Show" segue to a detail UIViewController. This UIViewController should allow the user to fill in their name and address. It should also display how many items have been added to "shopping list".

//In the same view controller, add a button that schedules a local notification saying that the user's delivery will be to their address in 15 minutes. The notification's content must contain their name and address.
